A vagrant based on ubuntu/trusty64 for Virtual Box packed with:

-> XFCE
-> git
-> docker
-> docker-compose
-> npm
-> composer
-> chrome

To start:

1. Login to the box, vagrant:vagrant
2. Type startx and hit enter.

Note:

Default configurations during vagrant init were not edited. I've just added provisions.
