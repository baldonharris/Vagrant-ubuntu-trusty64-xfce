A vagrant box based on ubuntu/trusty64 for Virtual Box with provisions such as:

1. XFCE
2. git
3. docker
4. docker-compose
5. npm
6. composer
7. chrome

To start:

1. Login to the box, vagrant:vagrant
2. Type startx and hit enter.

Note:

Default configurations during vagrant init were not edited. I've just added provisions.
